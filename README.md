# COM 421 - Personal website
The list of features and things I would like to add:
1. I have a few projects; however, I do not have any pictures or videos of them. Therefore, when designing and creating new projects, I will try to take a picture or a result and post it on the website.
2. I would like to implement something like a blog. So, people can keep track of my progress in projects or examine my current interest. For instance, currently, I am interested in computer vision, and in the process of conducting research, I will have an opportunity to share the process.
3. Making a website with interactive features sounds very interesting. Thus, in the future, I will try to add something (to make it like the Apple website with scrolling and moving items).
4. I would like to add something to the front page to make it more eye-catching. I am thinking about adding a picture of me or a piece of art.
5. Currently, I do not like how the buttons look, and I am not sure what to replace them with.
6. I would like to change the transitions from #main section to #about section
7. Obviously, I need to add more content such as an elevator pitch.
